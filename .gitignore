#-  Git configuration file

#-  .gitignore ~~
#
#   This file contains user-defined filename patterns that Git should ignore
#   when it computes changes. Typically, we want to ignore any hidden or
#   temporary files created by the operating system or text editor, but I must
#   stress that we do not, under _any_ circumstances, want to add a rule that
#   may cause us to exclude an important file accidentally. Thus, my own policy
#   is to script and monitor every step of my workflow except for version
#   control -- always execute your commits manually!
