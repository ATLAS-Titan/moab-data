#   This program is a shell script written for submission to Rhea via PBS. For
#   more information, see

#
#   Right now, this job runs once per day on Rhea via a cron job on a Data 
#   Transfer Node (DTN), and it originally took 3-4 minutes to run to build
#   from scratch. On my laptop, it updates in less than a second, so I fully
#   expect 10 minutes on a dedicated node on Rhea to be overkill.
#
#   NOTE: The lines beginning with "#PBS" are not comments. They are directives
#   to the PBS system, and they will only be read if every line preceding them
#   in the file is a commented line.
