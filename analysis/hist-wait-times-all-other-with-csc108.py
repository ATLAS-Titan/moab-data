#   This creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of the wait times
#   for all jobs not belonging to CSC108 which were submitted while CSC108 had
#   at least one active job running in backfill.
#
#   As always, remember to run the following on OLCF machines:

#       $ module load python_anaconda2

  # time-related fields are properly sequenced and returns rows representing
  # other projects' jobs which were submitted while CSC108 had at least one

  # consider the CSC108 jobs' submission times because they always have lower
