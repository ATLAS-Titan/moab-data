#-  hist-time-to-first-block.py ~~
#
#   This program provides a solution to the following problem:
#
#   Find the distribution of "time to first block" for CSC108 backfill jobs
#   that cause blocks, where "time to first block" is defined as the smallest
#   interval between the start time of the job and the sample time of a sample
#   in which blocks were observed.
#
#   As always, remember to run the following on OLCF machines:
#
#       $ module load python_anaconda2
#
#                                                       ~~ (c) SRW, 26 Jul 2018
