#   This is a first stab at estimating the "blocking probability", which is
#   equal to the fraction of sample times in which jobs in the eligible queue
#   would have run in backfill except CSC108 had already claimed backfill's
#   resources.
#
#   Initial value using data through June 20 is 842/1758 (0.48), which is much
#   higher than expected. This value may indicate that I got the conditions
#   totally wrong.
