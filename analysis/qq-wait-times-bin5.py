#
#   This program creates a Quantile-Quantile plot (or more accurately here, a
#   Percentile-Percentile plot) of the distributions for the wait times of
#   bin 5 jobs submitted by non-CSC108 projects, with and without CSC108
#   running active jobs in backfill.
#
#   Bin 5 jobs use 125 nodes or less.
#
#   This program will not run correctly on OLCF machines unless the appropriate
#   module has already been loaded:
#
#       $ module load python_anaconda2

  # First, gather data that represents two distributions. This query computes
  # WaitTime for bin 5 jobs submitted by projects other than CSC108, when
  # CSC108 is running jobs in backfill. It checks to make sure that the various
  # time-related fields are properly sequenced and returns rows representing
  # other projects' jobs which were submitted while CSC108 had at least one
  # active job running in backfill. I would argue that there is no need to
  # consider the CSC108 jobs' submission times because they always have lower
  # priority than other jobs.

  # Note that there is significantly more data available if I use the "active"
  # table instead of "completed", but the query runs much slower in that case.
  # This will instead serve as a placeholder for new plots that will be created
  # once dates are chosen for specific time intervals.
