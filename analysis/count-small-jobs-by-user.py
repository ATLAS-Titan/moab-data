#-  count-small-jobs-by-user.py ~~
#
#   This program answers a question that arose from answering the following:
#
#   Find the SampleID at which a user was running his/her highest number of
#   concurrent jobs within the last 30 days, along with the number of nodes
#   being used by those jobs.
#
#   While answering this question, results showed that some users were running
#   large numbers of so-called "bin 5" jobs, which use less than 125 nodes. The
#   official OLCF policy only allows a user to run 2 such jobs simultaneously. 
#
