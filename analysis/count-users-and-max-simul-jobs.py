#   This program counts the number of users who ran 10 or more simultaneous
#   jobs in the last 30 days, and it also returns the highest number of
#   simultaneous jobs for that time period. It also returns a lot of extra
#   fields because this program is the saved result of an interactive
#   exploration.
