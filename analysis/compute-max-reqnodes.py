#-  compute-max-reqnodes.py ~~
#
#   This program is an example to help me understand how to use a searched
#   CASE statement in SQL in order to solve the following problem:
#
#       We need to do almost everything in terms of compute nodes, not
#       processors. The columns in the data always give processors and only
#       give nodes in 3% of rows. Processors is always a multiple of nodes
#       (factor of 16), but in the cases when nodes is present, the factor is
#       not 16. This means we need to use the nodes value when it is present
#       and use the processors value divided by 16 when nodes is null.
#
#   I'm not sure if this happens due to the "ppn" (processors per node) option
#   in PBS or what, but this program exists to show how to work around the
#   problem without simply populating the non-null values in ReqNodes.
