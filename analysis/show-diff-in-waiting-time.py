#   This program provides a rough answer to the question, what is the
#   difference in jobs' wait times on Titan when CSC108 is running backfill
#   jobs and when CSC108 is not running backfill jobs?
#
#   It is hard-coded to investigate two particular time intervals for which
#   CSC108 was not running any jobs for approximately 100 hours each.
