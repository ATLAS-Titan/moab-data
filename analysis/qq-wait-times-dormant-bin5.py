#-  qq-wait-times-dormant-bin5.py ~~
#
#   This program creates a Quantile-Quantile plot (or more accurately here, a
#   Percentile-Percentile plot) of the distributions for the wait times of
#   bin 5 jobs submitted by non-CSC108 projects during the two weeks prior to
#   the "dormant" period from July 21 through August 4, when CSC108 was not
#   running ATLAS jobs, versus the wait times experienced during the dormant
#   period itself.
#
#   This program will not run correctly on OLCF machines unless the appropriate
#   module has already been loaded:
#
#       $ module load python_anaconda2
#
